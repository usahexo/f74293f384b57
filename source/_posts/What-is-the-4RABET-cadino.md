#  What is the origin of the 4RABET cadino?

The 4RABET casino is a descendant of the popular European game "Roulette." The game was brought over to America by French immigrants in the late 1700s, and soon became a staple of casino gaming.

The modern version of Roulette is believed to have been invented by Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician and physicist, in the 17th century. The game allows players to place bets on a number, colors, or whether the ball will land on an odd or even number.

Roulette quickly gained in popularity and soon became one of the most popular games in Europe. In 1842, Francois and Louis Blanc developed the now standard "en prison" rule, which allowed players to keep their bet if the ball landed on their chosen number.

The 4RABET casino takes its name from the four possible outcomes of the game: red (rouge), black (noir), even (pair), and odd (impair).

#  What are the main rules of the 4RABET cadino?

4RABET is a card game for two or more players, each of whom receives a pack of sixteen cards. The aim of the game is to lose all your cards.

The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points. After the shuffle, one player begins by placed any card on the table. The next player must then place a card on the table that is either equal to the first card, or one higher in rank. If they cannot play a card, they must pick up another card from the deck and add it to their hand.

When both players have no cards left in their hands the player with the highest valued card on the table wins the round and collects all of the cards. That player then starts the next round by placing any card on the table. The winner is the first player to lose all their cards.
