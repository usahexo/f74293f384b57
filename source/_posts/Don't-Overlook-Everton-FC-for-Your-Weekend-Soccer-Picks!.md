#  Everton FC a Good Bet to Cover the Spread This Weekend

This is an article on Premier League betting, focusing on Everton FC. Everton is a good team with a lot of talent, and they should be able to cover the spread against most opponents this season.

Everton had a strong finish to the 2017-18 campaign, and they have carried that form into the new season. They have already beaten Chelsea and Wolves this season, and they should be able to beat most teams in the Premier League.

The main reason why Everton is a good bet to cover the spread this weekend is because of their attacking talent. Richarlison has been excellent so far this season, and he will be looking to score some goals against his former club. Gylfi Sigurdsson is also a dangerous player who can create chances for his teammates.

Everton also has a strong defense, which should help them keep clean sheets against some of the weaker teams in the Premier League. This should give them a good chance of covering the spread in their matches.

There are some doubts about Everton’s ability to compete in the Premier League this season, but they have already shown that they are capable of winning against top teams. They should be able to beat most of the teams in the league, and this makes them a good bet to cover the spread this weekend.

#  Everton FC Can Be Trusted Not to Blow a Lead

There are many football clubs around the world that are known for their dramatic collapses when in a position of strength. Teams like Newcastle United and Liverpool fall into this category, as they have a history of squandering leads and ultimately losing out on potential points and titles.

Everton FC, on the other hand, have always been a club that can be counted on not to blow a lead. This is evident by their long-standing record of never having squandered a multi-goal lead. In fact, they have only ever lost one game in which they held a lead of two goals or more – and that was back in 1914!

This remarkable record is a testament to Everton’s discipline and determination, as they have always been able to hold on to their leads no matter what the circumstances. Whether they are up against a top team or fighting for relegation, Everton have always shown themselves to be capable of holding on to a lead.

This is due, in part, to the experience and leadership of players like Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines. These veterans know how to keep their composure under pressure and guide the rest of the team through difficult situations. They help make sure that Everton don’t get complacent when in the lead, and instead maintain their focus until the final whistle.

In addition to this experienced core, Everton also have some dangerous attacking players who can kill off games with ease. Players like Cenk Tosun and Gylfi Sigurdsson are capable of scoring crucial goals at any moment, which makes it difficult for opposing teams to mount a comeback.

Overall, Everton FC can be trusted not to blow a lead. This is a trait that has served them well throughout the years, as they have never let down their fans by blowing an important advantage.

#  Bank on Everton FC to Win Straight Up This Weekend

While Everton FC may be in the midst of a less-than-stellar season, they are still a club with a ton of talent. And this weekend, they have a great opportunity to earn some much-needed points as they host relegation-threatened Swansea City at Goodison Park.

Everton come into the match having lost just once in their last six Premier League fixtures, and they’ll look to build on that strong form against Swansea. Gylfi Sigurdsson—the playmaker who made the move from Swansea to Everton in the summer—will no doubt be looking to make an impact against his former club, and he could be the key to success for the Toffees this weekend.

Swansea, on the other hand, have been struggling mightily of late. The Welsh side has only won one of their last 10 Premier League matches, and they currently sit just two points above the relegation zone. With their backs against the wall, Swansea are sure to give Everton a tough fight this weekend. But with home field advantage and all the talent at their disposal, Everton should be able to come out on top.

Given Swansea’s poor form and Everton’s recent resurgence, there is plenty of value to be had in betting on the Toffees to win straight up this weekend. So don’t hesitate to put your money on Everton FC—they should have no problem taking all three points from Swansea City.

#  Against the Odds: Everton FC Could Pull off an Upset

Champions League qualification was never really on the cards for Everton Football Club this season. After a disappointing seventh-place finish in the Premier League last year, many pundits and fans alike wrote the Toffees off before a ball had even been kicked.

However, starting the 2018/19 campaign with two wins and two clean sheets has given new manager Marco Silva something to build on. And with some very winnable fixtures coming up over the next few weeks, Everton could find themselves in the Champions League places by the end of September.

The first obstacle will be Southampton, who Everton face at Goodison Park this Saturday. The Saints have made a poor start to the season, losing both of their opening games 1-0. This will give Everton plenty of confidence ahead of what is sure to be a tough but winnable match.

After Southampton, Everton face Watford (H), Crystal Palace (A), Bournemouth (H), and Fulham (A). With the exception of Fulham – newly promoted to the Premier League – all of these teams are currently in the bottom half of the table.

So while it is not impossible for Everton to miss out on Champions League qualification altogether, they will certainly have every opportunity to get there if they continue playing as well as they have been so far this season.
