#  How is 4RABET connected to Leeds United?

4RABET is the latest online betting company to be linked with Leeds United. The company’s logo appeared on the back of the seats in the East Stand at Elland Road at Saturday’s game against Brentford.

This follows news that a group of investors, fronted by Andrea Radrizzani, has taken a majority stake in the club. Radrizzani is also the founder and chairman of 4RABET.

It is not clear what role 4RABET will play at Leeds United. The company could simply be providing sponsorship for the club, or it could become more involved in running the team.

Some fans have raised concerns about the link between 4RABET and Leeds United, given that the company is relatively new and has no track record in sport sponsorship. Others have welcomed the investment by Radrizzani and believe that it could help to turn around the fortunes of the club.

There are still many unanswered questions about 4RABET’s involvement with Leeds United, but for now it appears that the two organisations are linked together.
