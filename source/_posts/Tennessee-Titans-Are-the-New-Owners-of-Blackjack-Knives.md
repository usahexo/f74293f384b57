#  Tennessee Titans ownership of blackjack knives raises eyebrows

In the state of Tennessee, it is legal for an individual to possess a blackjack knife. This type of knife has a long, protruding handle that curves into a club at the end and is used to strike an opponent. The Tennessee Titans football team recently came under scrutiny when it was revealed that the ownership group of the team also owns a company that produces blackjack knives.

Some people argue that it is not appropriate for the ownership group of a professional sports team to be associated with a product that can be used for violence. Others say that there is nothing wrong with owning a company that makes blackjack knives, as long as the team does not promote or condone violence. In fact, some people argue that owning a company that makes blackjack knives could actually be seen as a positive thing, as it shows that the owners are proactive and entrepreneurial.

No matter what people's opinions on the matter may be, one thing is clear: the ownership of the Tennessee Titans has raised eyebrows with its connection to blackjack knives.
