#  How To Calculate The Probability Of The Pittsburgh Pirates Winning

The Pittsburgh Pirates have had a tumultuous past few years. However, they seem to be on the upswing, as they finished the 2017 season with a record of 82-79. This was good enough for third place in the National League Central Division.

One of the biggest questions facing the Pirates this offseason is whether they can build on their 2017 success and contend for a playoff berth in 2018. To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability of the Pirates winning in 2018.

In order to calculate this probability, we need to look at some factors that will impact their chances of winning. These factors include their odds of winning each game, as well as their chances of winning the division and making it to the playoffs.

We can start by looking at their odds of winning each game. These odds will vary depending on who they are playing and where the game is taking place. However, we can use average odds from Fangraphs to get a general idea of their chances.

According to Fangraphs, the Pirates have an average win expectancy of 47 percent when playing at home and 38 percent when playing on the road. This gives them an overall win expectancy of 43 percent.

Next, we need to look at their chances of winning the division and making it to the playoffs. The Pirates finished last season three games behind the Cincinnati Reds for first place in the National League Central Division. They also finished six games behind the Milwaukee Brewers for the final playoff spot in the National League.

This means that their chances of winning the division are about six percent and their chances of making it to the playoffs are about eleven percent. When combined, these two probabilities give us a total probability of seventeen percent that the Pirates will win in 2018.

#  What Are The Chances Of A Pittsburgh Pirates Victory In The Next Game?

Pittsburgh Pirates fans everywhere are asking themselves this question. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer. The best way to determine the chances of a Pirates win is to look at the team's past performance and compare it to the opposing team's.

For example, in their last game against the Cincinnati Reds, the Pirates had a 45% chance of winning. This was based on their past performance against the Reds. Taking this information into account, we can estimate that the Pirates have a 55% chance of winning against the Milwaukee Brewers.

However, these percentages can change quickly based on how each team performs in their next game. So, it is important to keep track of both teams' latest stats before making any final determinations.

All in all, while there is no guarantee that the Pirates will win their next game, their chances are better than average. Go Bucs!
