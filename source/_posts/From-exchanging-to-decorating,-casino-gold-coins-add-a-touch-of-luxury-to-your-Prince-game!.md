#  Coin exchange guide: What do casino gold coins do in the Prince game?

Gold coins in casino slots games like Prince can have different purposes, depending on the game. In some games, they may only be used for betting, while in others they may also serve as a means of cashing out your winnings. It's important to familiarize yourself with the game's coin exchange rules before playing, so you know exactly what to do when you hit a winning combination.

In Prince, casino gold coins are used for both betting and cashing out. When you win a coin combination, the coins will be automatically added to your coin total. You can then use these coins to place bets on the next spin, or you can collect them and cash out your winnings. If you decide to cash out, you'll need to press the Collect button and then choose how many coins you want to collect. The amount of coins you receive will be based on the payout multiplier for that particular winning combination.

It's important to note that not all combinations result in a payout. In order to receive a payout, you must have at least one winning symbol in each of the three winning positions on the payline. If you don't have any winning symbols in any of the positions, your bet will simply be returned to you.

Now that you know how coin exchanges work in Prince, it's time to start playing and see how big your jackpot can get!
