# 2017: How to Tell If a Casino Slot Machine Is Ready to Pay

When it comes to playing casino slot machines, one question that often comes to mind is how to tell if a machine is ready to pay out. While it's impossible to predict when a machine will hit a jackpot, there are a few things you can look out for that might indicate a machine is ready to pay.

1. Look for machines that have not paid out in a while

If a machine hasn't paid out in a while, it might be due for a win. While this isn't a guarantee, it's often the case that machines that have gone without a win for a while are more likely to pay out.

2. Check the payout percentage

All slot machines have a payout percentage, which is the amount of money the machine pays out compared to the amount of money that's wagered. You can usually find this information on the machine itself or by asking a casino employee. Look for machines with a higher payout percentage, as these are more likely to pay out.

3. Look for machines with a lower maximum bet

Machines with a lower maximum bet may not offer the biggest payouts, but they are more likely to pay out smaller amounts more frequently. This means you'll have a better chance of winning something, even if it's not a jackpot.

4. Play machines that have just been serviced

If a machine has just been serviced, it's possible that the technicians have made adjustments to the machine that make it more likely to pay out. Try playing machines that have just been serviced, as these might be the ones that are most likely to pay out.

5. Trust your instincts

At the end of the day, the best way to tell if a machine is ready to pay is to trust your instincts. If you feel like a machine is going to pay out, it's worth taking a chance and playing it. Just remember that there's no guarantee that you'll win, so always play responsibly and within your means.

In conclusion, there's no surefire way to tell if a casino slot machine is ready to pay out. However, by keeping an eye out for machines that haven't paid out in a while, checking the payout percentage, playing machines with a lower maximum bet, trying machines that have just been serviced, and trusting your instincts, you can increase your chances of hitting a win. Remember to always gamble responsibly and have fun!
