The tiny principality of Liechtenstein is now home to Foxwood, a new casino that is larger than many small countries. Slot machines are the main focus of the casino, with 500 on offer. This is in addition to blackjack, roulette and poker tables.

Foxwood has been eagerly anticipated by the people of Liechtenstein. It replaces an older, smaller casino that closed down last year. The new casino is expected to bring much-needed jobs and tourism revenue to the country.

One of the main selling points of Foxwood is its location in Liechtenstein. The principality is located in the heart of Europe, making it easy for tourists from all over to visit. It's also conveniently close to Zurich airport, which makes it a great destination for a weekend getaway.

Liechtenstein has been enjoying something of a tourism boom in recent years. This is due in part to its low taxes and relaxed approach to regulation. Foxwood is set to capitalize on this trend, and could help Liechtenstein become a premier gaming destination in Europe.
