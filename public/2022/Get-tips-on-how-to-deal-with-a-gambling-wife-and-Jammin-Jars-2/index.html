If you are married to someone who is addicted to gambling, you may be feeling helpless and alone. It is important to remember that you are not alone. There are many people who are in the same situation as you. There are also many resources available to help you deal with your gambling wife.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lying about gambling or hiding gambling activity</li>
<li>Excessive spending on gambling</li>
<li>Feeling anxious or depressed when not able to gamble</li>
<li>isolate themselves from friends and family members in order to gamble</li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice any of these signs in your spouse, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available, including therapy and support groups. You can also find helpful information online.</p>
<p>One thing that you can do to help yourself is to set boundaries with your spouse. This includes establishing rules about how much money they can spend on gambling and how often they are allowed to gamble. It is also important to have regular conversations with your spouse about their gambling habit. This will help keep communication open and allow for solutions to be discussed openly.</p>
<p>It is also important to take care of yourself emotionally and mentally. You may find that you need some time for yourself, away from your spouse’s problems. This may mean attending a support group or seeing a therapist independently. Taking care of yourself will allow you to be stronger when dealing with your spouse’s addiction.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that change takes time. Your spouse’s addiction did not develop overnight and it will not go away overnight either. Be patient and stay strong. You can do this!</p>
