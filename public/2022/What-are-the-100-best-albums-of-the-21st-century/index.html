<h1 id="How-were-the-albums-chosen"><a href="#How-were-the-albums-chosen" class="headerlink" title="How were the albums chosen?"></a>How were the albums chosen?</h1><p>This list of the 100 best albums of all time was created by compiling the votes of 145 music experts.</p>
<p>The albums were chosen based on their historic impact, influence on other artists, and lasting popularity.</p>
<p>There was no ranking or order to the albums because they are all considered to be masterpieces in their own right.</p>
<h1 id="The-Beatles-The-Beatles-White-Album"><a href="#The-Beatles-The-Beatles-White-Album" class="headerlink" title="The Beatles - The Beatles (White Album)"></a>The Beatles - The Beatles (White Album)</h1><p>Released in 1968, The Beatles (White Album) is the iconic British rock band’s ninth studio album.</p>
<p>Considered one of the greatest albums ever made, it features some of the group’s most famous songs, including “Hey Jude” and “Revolution”.</p>
<p>The Beatles (White Album) was a groundbreaking release that helped to define rock music as we know it today.</p>
<h1 id="The-Beach-Boys-Pet-Sounds"><a href="#The-Beach-Boys-Pet-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds"></a>The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds</h1><p>Released in 1966, Pet Sounds is the eleventh studio album by The Beach Boys.</p>
<p> Considered a seminal work in the history of pop music, Pet Sounds is often cited as one of the most important albums ever released.</p>
<p>The album’s innovative production techniques and incorporation of classical elements helped to usher in a new era of popular music.</p>
<h1 id="The-Rolling-Stones-Exile-on-Main-Street"><a href="#The-Rolling-Stones-Exile-on-Main-Street" class="headerlink" title="The Rolling Stones - Exile on Main Street"></a>The Rolling Stones - Exile on Main Street</h1><p>Released in 1972, Exile on Main Street is the tenth studio album by The Rolling Stones.</p>
<p> Recorded in France during a period of drug-addled turmoil, Exile on Main Street is considered to be one of the band’s finest works.</p>
<p> Featuring classic tracks such as “Tumbling Dice” and “Sweet Virginia”, this album is a must-listen for any fan of classic rock.”</p>
<h1 id="What-will-be-the-criteria-for-future-albums"><a href="#What-will-be-the-criteria-for-future-albums" class="headerlink" title="What will be the criteria for future albums?"></a>What will be the criteria for future albums?</h1><p>Looking at how the music industry has changed in the past 10 years, it is hard to determine what criteria will be used for an album in the future. Physical album sales have decreased while streaming services have become more popular. This has caused a decline in revenue for the music industry. In order to combat this and ensure that albums remain profitable, the criteria for an album may need to change.</p>
<p>One option is to make albums shorter. If an album is only 10-15 songs, then it can be streamed more times on streaming services and generate more revenue. There are also less opportunities for someone to skip a song if the album is shorter. Another option is to release singles more frequently and not wait until an album is completed before releasing any new music. This would allow listeners to stay engaged with the artist and continue to stream their music.</p>
<p>It is also possible that albums will no longer be released in their traditional format. Instead of buying a CD or downloading an album, listeners could pay a monthly fee and have access to an endless amount of music. This type of service already exists but has not had much success because there are not many exclusive albums or artists that are available on the service. The industry will need to find a way to entice listeners to pay for this type of service if they want it to succeed.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the criteria for an album may need to change in order for the music industry to remain profitable. If albums are shorter or released more frequently, then listeners will be more likely to stream them on streaming services. Alternatively, if listeners can access unlimited music for a monthly fee, then they may be more likely to subscribe. It will be interesting to see how the industry evolves over the next few years and what changes are made to the criteria for albums</p>
<h1 id="How-does-this-list-compare-to-similar-lists-compiled-in-previous-decades"><a href="#How-does-this-list-compare-to-similar-lists-compiled-in-previous-decades" class="headerlink" title="How does this list compare to similar lists compiled in previous decades?"></a>How does this list compare to similar lists compiled in previous decades?</h1><p>In the summer of 2018, Slate Magazine compiled a list of “The 25 Greatest Sci-Fi Movies of the 21st Century (So Far).” The inclusion of recent films like “Get Out” and “ Upgrade “ and classics like “E.T.” and “ Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope “ provoked criticism from some readers who felt that older titles were unfairly omitted or given short shrift. </p>
<p>A similar debate played out in 2010, when the British Film Institute compiled its list of the “Top 100 British Films of All Time.” That list sparked outrage over the omission of popular films like “The Full Monty” and “ Trainspotting “, and accusations that the BFI was biased in favor of arthouse fare.</p>
<p>So how does this latest list compare to similar lists compiled in previous decades?</p>
<p> Well, for one thing, it’s much longer. The Slate list includes 25 films, while the BFI Top 100 features only 100 titles. And whereas the BFI list is restricted to British films, the Slate list features a more international mix of titles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some viewers might argue that the Slate list is too populist. It includes several mainstream Hollywood blockbusters while omitting more art-house fare.</p>
