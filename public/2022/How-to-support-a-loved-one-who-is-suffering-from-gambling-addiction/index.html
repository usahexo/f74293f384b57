<p>You can also help by setting boundaries. It is important that you don’t enable your loved one’s addiction by providing them with money or letting them borrow money to gamble with. You should also avoid going to casinos or other places where gambling is common.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep an eye on your loved one’s behavior as well. If they start exhibiting signs of gambling addiction, such as secretive behavior or increased financial stress, talk to them about it. Express your concerns and let them know that you are there to help if they need it.</p>
<p>Finally, be patient. Recovery from a gambling addiction can be a long process, and there may be setbacks along the way. But with support from family and friends, your loved one can overcome their addiction and start living a healthier life.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Establish boundaries for yourself and your loved one.</li>
</ol>
