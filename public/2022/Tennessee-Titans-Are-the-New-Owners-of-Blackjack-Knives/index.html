<p>“We are excited to become the new owners of Blackjack Knives,” said Titans owner Amy Adams Strunk. “This is a great company with a rich history and we look forward to building on its success in the future.”</p>
<p>Blackjack Knives was founded in 1978 by knife maker Black Jack Pendelton and his wife, Jeannie. The company is based in Tacoma, Washington and has been manufacturing and selling knives and edged weapons for over 40 years.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased that the Titans have decided to buy Blackjack Knives,” said Jeannie Pendelton. “They are a great organization with a lot of experience in running successful businesses. We know they will do a great job moving forward.”</p>
<p>The Pendeltons will continue to operate Blackjack Knives as an independent subsidiary of the Titans and will be actively involved in the company’s day-to-day operations.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Knives-Sold-to-Tennessee-Titans"><a href="#Blackjack-Knives-Sold-to-Tennessee-Titans" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Knives Sold to Tennessee Titans"></a>Blackjack Knives Sold to Tennessee Titans</h1><p>A knife company based in Tennessee has announced that it has agreed to a deal to sell its knives to the Tennessee Titans. Blackjack Knives, which is based in Morristown, said that it has agreed to a deal that will see its knives become the official knives of the Titans.</p>
<p>The company’s president, James Jeffers, said that the deal would help to raise awareness of the brand and its products. He added that Blackjack Knives was looking forward to working with the Titans and providing them with high-quality knives.</p>
<p>The Titans confirmed the deal on their Twitter account, saying that they were “excited” to be working with Blackjack Knives. The team is set to take on the Jacksonville Jaguars this weekend and will be hoping to secure their first win of the season.</p>
<h1 id="Tennessee-Titans-ownership-of-blackjack-knives-raises-eyebrows"><a href="#Tennessee-Titans-ownership-of-blackjack-knives-raises-eyebrows" class="headerlink" title="Tennessee Titans ownership of blackjack knives raises eyebrows"></a>Tennessee Titans ownership of blackjack knives raises eyebrows</h1><p>In the state of Tennessee, it is legal for an individual to possess a blackjack knife. This type of knife has a long, protruding handle that curves into a club at the end and is used to strike an opponent. The Tennessee Titans football team recently came under scrutiny when it was revealed that the ownership group of the team also owns a company that produces blackjack knives.</p>
<p>Some people argue that it is not appropriate for the ownership group of a professional sports team to be associated with a product that can be used for violence. Others say that there is nothing wrong with owning a company that makes blackjack knives, as long as the team does not promote or condone violence. In fact, some people argue that owning a company that makes blackjack knives could actually be seen as a positive thing, as it shows that the owners are proactive and entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>No matter what people’s opinions on the matter may be, one thing is clear: the ownership of the Tennessee Titans has raised eyebrows with its connection to blackjack knives.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-the-Tennessee-Titans-plan-to-do-with-Blackjack-Knives"><a href="#What-do-the-Tennessee-Titans-plan-to-do-with-Blackjack-Knives" class="headerlink" title="What do the Tennessee Titans plan to do with Blackjack Knives?"></a>What do the Tennessee Titans plan to do with Blackjack Knives?</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans are a professional football team that plays in the NFL. They were established in 1960 as the Houston Oilers and have played in Nashville, Tennessee since 1997. The team is owned by Bud Adams, Jr., who also owns theHouston Texas of the Arena Football League.</p>
<p>The Titans current helmet design is navy blue with white and light blue trim. The Titans wordmark is located on the sides of the helmet in light blue. The Titans also have a logotype which is used prominently on their uniforms and marketing materials. It consists of an “oil drop” which is divided into three sections by light and dark blue lines. In each section of the “oil drop”, there is a white letter “T”. This logotype was created by Nike in 2000.</p>
<p>The Titans have three primary colors – navy blue, white, and light blue – and use two secondary colors – silver and red. These colors are used on all of their uniforms and marketing materials.</p>
<p>The Titans Cheerleaders are known as the TopCats. They were established in 2003 and made their debut during the 2004 season. The team performs before each home game and at other community events throughout the year.</p>
<p>The Titans organization plans to do something with Blackjack Knives that has not been done before in the knife industry. Stay tuned for more information as it becomes available!</p>
<h1 id="Why-did-the-Tennessee-Titans-decide-to-purchase-Blackjack-Knives"><a href="#Why-did-the-Tennessee-Titans-decide-to-purchase-Blackjack-Knives" class="headerlink" title="Why did the Tennessee Titans decide to purchase Blackjack Knives?"></a>Why did the Tennessee Titans decide to purchase Blackjack Knives?</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans made the decision to purchase Blackjack Knives in order to improve their performance on the field. The knives are extremely durable and can withstand a lot of wear and tear, making them the perfect tool for players who need to be able to rely on their equipment. Blackjack Knives are also known for their sharp blades, which can come in handy when players need to cut through ropes or other materials.</p>
<p>The Titans organization is confident that the addition of Blackjack Knives will help the team achieve their goals this season. The players are already familiar with the knives and have been using them during practice sessions. This level of familiarity is important, as it allows players to feel comfortable with their equipment and perform at their best on game day.</p>
<p>In addition to purchasing knives for the team, the Titans have also partnered with Blackjack Knives to offer fans a chance to win a free knife. The giveaway will allow fans to enter for a chance to win one of five Blackjack knives. This is a great way for the team to connect with its fans and show its appreciation for their support.</p>
<p>Blackjack knives are an important part of the Tennessee Titans organization, and they will continue to play an important role in helping the team achieve success on the field.</p>
