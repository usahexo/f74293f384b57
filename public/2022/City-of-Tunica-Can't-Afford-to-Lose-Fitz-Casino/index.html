The casino employs over 1,000 people and generates $40 million in annual revenue for the city, according to Mayor Jerry Gist.</p>
<p>But the casino is in danger of closing due to financial troubles.</p>
<p>Owner Rick George has asked the state for a bailout, but so far, no help has been forthcoming.</p>
<p>George says the casino is losing money because of competition from casinos in neighboring states.</p>
<p>If the Fitz Casino were to close, it would be a major blow to Tunica’s economy. The city can’t afford to lose that kind of revenue.</p>

There has been little interest in the property, however, and the city is now considering other options for the future of the casino.</p>
<p>One possibility is that a new owner could be found for Fitzgerald Casino Tunica. Another possibility is that the casino could be torn down and replaced with something else.</p>
<p>No decisions have been made yet, and the city says it will continue to explore all options for the future of Fitzgerald Casino Tunica.</p>
<h1 id="3-Live-888-Eyes-Fitzgerald-Casino-Tunica-Amid-Slowing-Gambling-Market"><a href="#3-Live-888-Eyes-Fitzgerald-Casino-Tunica-Amid-Slowing-Gambling-Market" class="headerlink" title="3. Live 888 Eyes Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Amid Slowing Gambling Market"></a>3. Live 888 Eyes Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Amid Slowing Gambling Market</h1><p>Live 888 Eyes Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Amid Slowing Gambling Market</p>
<p>Gambling revenues in the state of Mississippi have been declining for the past few years, and casino operators in the state are looking for ways to shore up profits. One casino that is seen as particularly vulnerable is Fitzgerald Casino Tunica, which has been struggling to keep pace with its competitors. In an effort to bolster business, Fitzgerald Casino Tunica has announced that it will be adding live 888 eyes tables to its floor starting in March 2019.</p>
<p>The addition of live 888 eyes tables is part of a larger strategy by the casino to attract a younger audience. Fitzgerald Casino Tunica General Manager Brandon Gregory believes that the live 888 eyes format will be popular with millennials, who he says are “more comfortable with technology.” The casino plans to offer a range of tournaments and other promotions geared towards millennials.</p>
<p>888 Holdings, the company that produces the live 888 eyes software, is optimistic that the move will be successful. A spokesperson for 888 Holdings said that tunica “has all the ingredients for a very strong market” for live 888 eyes. The company expects that the addition of Fitzgerald Casino Tunica will help increase its market share in Mississippi.</p>
<p>The gambling market in Mississippi has been contracting for several years due to increased competition from neighboring states and the legalization of online gambling. According to figures from the Mississippi Gaming Commission, gambling revenues declined by 2 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. This trend is expected to continue in 2019, with total gambling revenues forecasted to decline by another 3 percent.</p>
<p>Despite this slowdown, casinos in Mississippi remain profitable, and there is still plenty of money to be made in the state’s gambling industry. In fact, Mississippi ranks second nationwide in terms of gambling revenues generated per capita. There are currently 33 casinos operating in Mississippi, and more are expected to open in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="4-Fitzgerald-Casino-Tunica-Likely-to-Change-Hands-as-Live-888-Falters"><a href="#4-Fitzgerald-Casino-Tunica-Likely-to-Change-Hands-as-Live-888-Falters" class="headerlink" title="4. Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Likely to Change Hands as Live 888 Falters"></a>4. Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Likely to Change Hands as Live 888 Falters</h1><p>According to industry insiders, Fitzgerald Casino Tunica is likely to change hands in the coming weeks as Live 888’s financial difficulties mount. Live 888, which purchased the casino in early 2017, has been struggling to keep the property profitable, and is said to be looking for a buyer.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald Casino Tunica is one of the largest casinos in Mississippi, and is a major employer in the region. The casino has been hit hard by the legal changes that have taken place in the state since its purchase by Live 888. These changes, which include the legalization of sports gambling and new restrictions on casino advertising, have led to a decline in revenue at Fitzgerald Casino Tunica.</p>
<p>It is not clear yet who will buy Fitzgerald Casino Tunica from Live 888, or what plans they may have for the property. However, it is expected that the new owner will be a gaming company with experience in the Mississippi market.</p>
<h1 id="5-Fitzgerald-Casino-Tunica-Ownership-Up-for-Grabs-as-Live-888-Struggles"><a href="#5-Fitzgerald-Casino-Tunica-Ownership-Up-for-Grabs-as-Live-888-Struggles" class="headerlink" title="5. Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Ownership Up for Grabs as Live 888 Struggles"></a>5. Fitzgerald Casino Tunica Ownership Up for Grabs as Live 888 Struggles</h1><p>The Fitzgerald Casino Tunica, which is located in Tunica Resorts, Mississippi, is up for grabs after its current owner, Live 888, has filed for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy filing states that the company owes creditors over $100 million. This has put the casino and its 1,000 employees in a difficult spot, as it is not clear what will happen to the casino or its workers.</p>
<p>There are a few potential buyers who are interested in the casino, but it is not clear who will end up purchasing it. One of the potential buyers is Jack Binion, who already owns two other casinos in Tunica. However, he is not the only bidder; there are also several companies from outside of Tunica that are interested in the property.</p>
<p>The Fitzgerald Casino Tunica has been struggling for some time now. Live 888 originally bought it for $240 million back in 2014, but it has been losing money ever since. In fact, the company has lost over $100 million since then. This has led to its current financial situation.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy filing also mentions that Live 888 plans to sell its other two casinos in Mississippi: Gold Strike Casino Resort and Bally’s Casino Resort. These casinos are also located in Tunica Resorts and have a combined workforce of 2,500 employees. It is not clear yet what will happen to these casinos and their employees if they are sold.</p>
<p>The Fitzgerald Casino Tunica’s current owner is hoping to find a buyer soon so that the casino can stay open and its employees can keep their jobs. However, with so many creditors owed money, it is unclear if anyone will be able to buy it for a price that makes sense for them.</p>
