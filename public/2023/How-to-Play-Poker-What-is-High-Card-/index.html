In other words, the highest-ranking card is the one that determines the winning hand.</p>
<p>For example, if you are playing Texas Hold’em and are dealt two hearts and three clubs, your high card would be the nine of clubs. If you are playing Omaha and are dealt two Aces, two kings, and a three, your high card would be the three.</p>
<p>In some cases, there can be more than one possible high card. For example, if you are playing Texas Hold’em and are dealt two hearts and three clubs, both the Ace of clubs and the nine of clubs would be high cards. If you are playing Omaha and are dealt two Aces, two kings, and a three, both the Aces would be high cards.</p>
<h1 id="Understanding-Poker-Hands-What-is-High-Card"><a href="#Understanding-Poker-Hands-What-is-High-Card" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Poker Hands: What is High Card?"></a>Understanding Poker Hands: What is High Card?</h1><p>When playing poker, the main aim for most players is to create the best five card hand possible. This can be done by using any combination of the cards in your hand, as well as the cards on the table.</p>
<p>There are many different types of poker hands, and each one is ranked in order from highest to lowest. The best possible hand is known as a royal flush, and consists of 10, J, Q, K and A all of the same suit. In descending order, the other poker hands are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Straight flush</li>
<li>Four of a kind</li>
<li>Full house</li>
<li>Flush</li>
<li>Straight</li>
<li>Three of a kind</li>
<li>Two pair</li>
<li>One pair</li>
<li>High card</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the ranking of poker hands goes from the best possible hand (a royal flush), all the way down to a high card. If two or more players have the same high card, then the player with the highest second card wins. And if needed, the third card (and so on) would determine who wins between two players with the same high card and second highest card.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-a-High-Card-in-Poker"><a href="#What-is-a-High-Card-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="What is a High Card in Poker?"></a>What is a High Card in Poker?</h1><p>In poker, the term “high card” is used to describe a hand in which no player has a pair, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house or four of a kind. The highest-valued card in the hand is the “high card.” This could be any rank from ace (highest) to two (lowest). </p>
<p>In the event that two or more players hold the same high card, the rank of the next highest card (and so on) is used to break the tie. If necessary, the player with the lowest-ranking card is declared the loser. </p>
<p>Some examples of hands with high cards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ace-King-Queen-Jack</li>
<li>Ten-Nine-Eight-Seven</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Poker-Hand-Rankings-What-is-a-High-Card"><a href="#Poker-Hand-Rankings-What-is-a-High-Card" class="headerlink" title="Poker Hand Rankings: What is a High Card?"></a>Poker Hand Rankings: What is a High Card?</h1><p>A high card hand is any hand that doesn’t contain a pair or better. This means the highest valued card in your hand is your “high card.” </p>
<p>Poker hands are ranked according to their value, with the best possible hand being a Royal Flush. A Royal Flush consists of 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace of the same suit. The second best hand is a Straight Flush, which is five consecutive cards of the same suit. </p>
<p>After the Straight Flush comes four of a kind, followed by a full house, then three of a kind, two pair, and finally one pair. An Ace can be either high or low in a straight (A-2-3-4-5), but not both (K-Q-J-T-9 would be an invalid straight). </p>
<p>If two players have the same high card, then the next highest card (and so on) determines the winner. For example, if two players have an Ace as their highest card, the player with the 2nd highest card would win.</p>
<h1 id="The-Importance-of-Knowing-Your-Poker-Hand-Rankings-What-is-High-Card"><a href="#The-Importance-of-Knowing-Your-Poker-Hand-Rankings-What-is-High-Card" class="headerlink" title="The Importance of Knowing Your Poker Hand Rankings: What is High Card?"></a>The Importance of Knowing Your Poker Hand Rankings: What is High Card?</h1><p>Last time, we looked at the ranking of poker hands from lowest to highest. Today, we’re going to explore what each type of hand is called.</p>
<p>The lowest ranking hand is known as high card. This simply means that you don’t have any of the combinations listed above and, instead, your strongest card is the highest one in your hand. For example, if you are dealt an Ace, a 2, a 3 and a 4, your hand would be called Ace high card. This is the weakest possible hand in poker.</p>
<p>If you have two cards of the same rank, such as two Aces or two Kings, then your hand is called a pair. If you have three cards of the same rank, such as three Queens or three Jacks, then your hand is called three of a kind. If you have four cards of the same rank, such as four sixes or four eights, then your hand is called four of a kind. Finally, if you have five cards of the same rank, such as five Kings or five Aces, then your hand is called a straight flush.</p>
<p>That’s it for today! Be sure to come back next time when we’ll be taking a look at the ranking of these different hands from strongest to weakest.</p>
